### Edwin-Kutsushi-Week-7-IP
Our these week IP project is to make prediction on the house price using different model and give a recommendation on the best model
### Overview 

As a Data Scientist, we work for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. we have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables. 

### Within our deliverable you are expected to:

*Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.
*Read and explore the given dataset.
*Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.
*Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
*Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.
*Performing regression analysis.
*Incorporate categorical independent variables into your models.
*Check for multicollinearity
*Provide a recommendation based on our analysis. 
*Create residual plots for your models, and assess heteroskedasticity using Barlett's test.
*Challenge our solution by providing insights on how we can make improvements in model improvement.
While performing your regression analysis, we will be required to perform modeling using the given regression techniques then evaluate their performance.

We will be then required to provide our observations and recommendation on the suitability of each of the tested models on their appropriateness of solving the given problem.
